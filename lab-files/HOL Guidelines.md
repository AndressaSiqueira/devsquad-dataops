# Guidelines
### Adding images in a HOL description
Please, always add files under the `media` folder.

**Example:**
![](media/adf-copy-data-blob-storage.png 'Launch Workspace')

### Referencing files to be used on the HOL
Most files will be imported to the learner's subscription during the Before the Hands On Lab phase.
If you still need to guide the learner to import a new file, please add it to the `lab-files` folder and reference it in the exercise description.

**Example:** Download [my-lab-file.json](lab-files/my-lab-file.json 'Download it now!') and import it to your workspace.
