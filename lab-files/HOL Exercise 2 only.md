## Exercise 2: Infrastructure As Code

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will explore and understand the structure and contents of the IaC folder, which contains all the scripts and templates necessary to correctly perform this and other exercises in this lab, using a best practices model.

### Technology Overview - Infrastructure As Code Practice

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as DevOps team uses for source code. Like the principle that the same source code generates the same binary, an IaC model generates the same environment every time it is applied. IaC is a key DevOps practice and is used in conjunction with continuous delivery. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code)

### Task 1: Understanding the IaC folder

In this task you will explore and understand the folder structure and scripts, templates contained in it for execution in IaC.

To proceed with the execution of the other exercises below, you must understand the structure of the "infrastructure-as-code" folder, as well as its content of templates and scripts.

### Technology Overview - Azure Resource Manager Templates

To implement infrastructure as code for your Azure solutions, use Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates). The template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax, which lets you state what you intend to deploy without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. In the template, you specify the resources to deploy and the properties for those resources. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview)

# Folder [infrastructure]

```
|infrastructure|
		|linkedTemplates|
			|compute|
				template.json
			|data|
				template.json
			|ml|
				template.json
			|roleAssigments|
				compute.json
				data.json
		|parameters|
			parameters.dev.json
			parameters.dev.template.json
			parameters.prod.json
			parameters.prod.template.json
			parameters.qa.json
			parameters.qa.template.json
		azuredeploy.json
```
# File: azuredeploy.json
Main template, with declared parameters, variables and resources. Here we use linkedTemplates.
*NOTE*: We have the option of using separate parameter files as a good practice when using IaC templates, without the need to change directly in the main template.

# Folder: linkedTemplates
```
|linkedTemplates|
			|compute|
				template.json
			|data|
				template.json
			|ml|
				template.json
			|roleAssigments|
				compute.json
				data.json
```

In linkedTemplates we have templates with "parts" of declared resources that are not declared in the main Template, in order to reuse and can link with other templates.
*NOTE*: linkedTemplates is a widely used practice, for better organization and handling of templates of different types of resources and being able to link them to any template.

![](media/compute-template-json.PNG 'compute-linkedTemplate')

# Folder: parameters
```
|parameters|
			parameters.dev.json
			parameters.dev.template.json
			parameters.prod.json
			parameters.prod.template.json
			parameters.qa.json
			parameters.qa.template.json
```

Parameters folder and directory with templates files with parameters and values to be used by linkedTemplates and main template, without the need to change directly in the main template.
*NOTE*: Using templates parameters is optional and can be used directly in the main template. However, following a model of good practice, the use separately is indicated.

### Task 2: Creating a new sandbox environment with Powershell

In this task you will learn how to create your first sandbox environment, with Azure Powershell scripts.

### Task 3: Checklist of IaC best practices

In this task you will understand the best practices in creating, executing and managing scripts and templates in IaC.

1. [ ] Does this code correctly implement the Azure resources and their properties?
2. [ ] Are the names of Azure resources correctly parameterized for all environments?
3. [ ] Are all Azure resources being implemented in the correct modules (e.g. data, compute)?
4. [ ] Are there acceptance tests that cover the newly added code and do they pass in the CI/CD pipelines?
5. [ ] Do the tests for this code correctly test the code?
6. [ ] Is the code documented well?
7. [ ] Have secrets been stripped before committing?
8. [ ] Is PII and EUII treated correctly? In particular, make sure the code is not logging objects or strings that might contain PII (e.g. request headers).
9. [ ] Is the deployment of the code scripted such that it is repeatable and ideally declarative?
10. [ ] Is the PR a relatively small change? Optimal PR sizes for code reviews are typically described in terms like embodying less than three days of work or having [200 or fewer changed lines of code](https://smallbusinessprogramming.com/optimal-pull-request-size/). If not, suggest smaller user stories or more frequent PRs in the future to reduce the amount of code being reviewed in one PR.
